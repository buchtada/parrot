# Parrot

A collection of projects exploring the concept of "parroting" across different domains - from predictive algorithms that echo patterns to language learning through repetition and mimicry.

## Overview

This repository contains two distinct projects unified by the theme of how systems and humans learn through parroting - the act of repeating, echoing, and reproducing patterns.

## Projects

### 1. Parrot Forecast

Location: `parrot-forecast/`

Algorithms and models that "parrot" historical patterns to make predictions. This project explores:

- Pattern recognition and reproduction in time series data
- Predictive models that learn by echoing historical trends
- Forecasting algorithms that mimic past behavior to predict future outcomes

**Use Cases:**
- Weather prediction through historical pattern matching
- Stock market trend analysis
- Seasonal behavior forecasting

### 2. Language Parrot

Location: `language-parrot/`

A language learning system based on the principle of parroting - how humans acquire new languages through repetition, mimicry, and gradual internalization.

**Explores:**
- Spaced repetition techniques
- Shadowing and echo learning methods
- Pattern recognition in language acquisition
- Phonetic mimicry and pronunciation training

**Approach:**
- Learn through imitation and repetition
- Build fluency by parroting native speakers
- Reinforce memory through cyclic review

## Philosophy

Both projects embrace the parrot metaphor - recognizing that much of learning, whether in machines or humans, involves sophisticated forms of repetition and pattern reproduction. Rather than viewing "parroting" as mere mindless copying, these projects explore how intelligent parroting forms the foundation of prediction and learning.

## Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions and documentation.
