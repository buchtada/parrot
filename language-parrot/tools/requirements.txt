# Tuti Parrot Requirements
# Python 3.8+

# No external dependencies required!
# The app uses only Python standard library:
# - json (for lesson loading)
# - pathlib (for file handling)
# - dataclasses (for data structures)
# - datetime (for progress tracking)
# - time (for exercise delays)

# Optional future enhancements could add:
# - playsound>=1.3.0  # For audio playback
# - rich>=13.0.0      # For enhanced terminal UI
# - pydantic>=2.0.0   # For better data validation
